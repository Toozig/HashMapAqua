==================
cpp_ex3.tar contains the following files:

    -HashMap.hpp
        Description : This file contains the template  for the HashMap container and it' iterator.

    -SpamDetector.cpp
        Description : This file contains the main function of the SpamDetector program.



Classes Structure-


                               |---Parser
                        uses   |
        SpamDetector ----------+
                               |
                               |---HashMap


         SpamDetector function used the Parser, which is an abstract class to parse the given files.
         The parsed data is being proccessed into HashMap and the scoring part using it to decied if
         if a mail is Spam or not.


About the Design:
    The Template of the hashMap is basic and follows the given pdf instructions.
    Since I've used array and vector to create the Hash map, and they both comes with an iterator,
    I've chose to use this and my iterator save index for the array and to the vector that using index-points to
    the current object.

    For the parser i've used the one from the last ex with changes according to the given mission.
    This time i saw no reason fro not making it a static class.
